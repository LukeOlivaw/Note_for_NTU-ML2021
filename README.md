# Note_for_NTU-ML2021
This is a note of Machine Learning 2021 spring, a widely-honored course by Hung-yi Lee, Professor at National Taiwan University. It is expected to cover all important points taught in that course, although that may make it a little missy. With 15 chapters, this note involves not only classical ML but also a lot of deep learning, reinforcement learning, and meta learning.  
The readers are expected to master modest amounts of basic calculus, linear algebra, probability, as well as programming. However, this course aims to give readers a rough but wide knowledge of ML, and mathematical rigor is considered secondary.  
This note has been authorized by Prof. Lee. The webpage of the course is https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/ml/2021-spring.html.  
For more information, you can download the PDF file and read the preface, epilogue and afterword.
